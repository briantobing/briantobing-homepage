          The Future Engineer
        </Heading>
        <Text mb={4}>
          I believe the future structural engineer must be both a technical expert and a digital innovator. As AI continues to transform our approach to design and analysis, I'm passionate about leveraging these tools to enhance our capabilities in structural calculations, CAD development, and project optimization. This technological integration isn't just about efficiencyâ€”it's about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in structural design.
