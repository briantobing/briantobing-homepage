        Hi, I'm Brian Tobing, a Civil Engineering student at the University of Toronto with a vision for the future of structural engineering. In an era where artificial intelligence is revolutionizing our industry, I position myself at the intersection of traditional structural engineering principles and emerging technological innovations.

      <Text mb={4}>
        I believe the future structural engineer must be both a technical expert and a digital innovator. As AI continues to transform our approach to design and analysis, I'm passionate about leveraging these tools to enhance our capabilities in structural calculations, CAD development, and project optimization. This technological integration isn't just about efficiencyâ€”it's about pushing the boundaries of what's possible in structural design.

        Looking ahead, I envision a practice where AI assists engineers in rapid prototyping of structural solutions, automated code compliance checks, and optimization of material usage. My goal is to lead projects where traditional engineering wisdom meets computational innovation, creating more sustainable, efficient, and ambitious structures that define city skylines.
